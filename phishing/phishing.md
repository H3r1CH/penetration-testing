## Writing Convincing Phishing Emails

We have three things to work with regarding phishing emails: the sender's email address, the subject, and the content.

**The Senders Address:**

Ideally, the sender's address would be from a domain name that spoofs a significant brand, a known contact, or a coworker. See the Choosing A Phishing Domain task below for more information on this.

To find what brands or people a victim interacts with, you can employ OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tactics. For example:

* Observe their social media account for any brands or friends they talk to.
* Searching Google for the victim's name and rough location for any reviews the victim may have left about local businesses or brands.
* Looking at the victim's business website to find suppliers.
* Looking at LinkedIn to find coworkers of the victim.

**The Subject:**

You should set the subject to something quite urgent, worrying, or piques the victim's curiosity, so they do not ignore it and act on it quickly.

Examples of this could be:

1. Your account has been compromised.
2. Your package has been dispatched/shipped.
3. Staff payroll information (do not forward!)
4. Your photos have been published.

**The Content:**

If impersonating a brand or supplier, it would be pertinent to research their standard email templates and branding (style, logo's images, signoffs etc.) and make your content look the same as theirs, so the victim doesn't expect anything. If impersonating a contact or coworker, it could be beneficial to contact them; first, they may have some branding in their template, have a particular email signature or even something small such as how they refer to themselves, for example, someone might have the name Dorothy and their email is dorothy@company.thm. Still, in their signature, it might say "Best Regards, Dot". Learning these somewhat small things can sometimes have quite dramatic psychological effects on the victim and convince them more to open and act on the email.

If you've set up a spoof website to harvest data or distribute malware, the links to this should be disguised using the [**anchor text**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor\_text) and changing it either to some text which says "Click Here" or changing it to a correct looking link that reflects the business you are spoofing, for example:

`<a href="http://spoofsite.thm">Click Here</a>`

`<a href="http://spoofsite.thm">https://onlinebank.thm</a>`

## Phishing Infrastructure

#### Domain Name

You'll need to register either an authentic-looking domain name or one that mimics the identity of another domain. See task 5 for details on how to create the perfect domain name.

#### SSL/TLS Certificates

Creating SSL/TLS certificates for your chosen domain name will add an extra layer of authenticity to the attack.

#### Email Server/Account

You'll need to either set up an email server or register with an SMTP email provider.

#### DNS Records

Setting up DNS Records such as SPF, DKIM, DMARC will improve the deliverability of your emails and make sure they're getting into the inbox rather than the spam folder.

#### Web Server

You'll need to set up webservers or purchase web hosting from a company to host your phishing websites. Adding SSL/TLS to the websites will give them an extra layer of authenticity.

#### Analytics

When a phishing campaign is part of a red team engagement, keeping analytics information is more important. You'll need something to keep track of the emails that have been sent, opened or clicked. You'll also need to combine it with information from your phishing websites for which users have supplied personal information or downloaded software.

#### Automation and Useful Software

Some of the above infrastructures can be quickly automated by using the below tools.

#### GoPhish (Open-Source Phishing Framework

[GoPhish ](https://getgophish.com)is a web-based framework to make setting up phishing campaigns more straightforward. GoPhish allows you to store your SMTP server settings for sending emails, has a web-based tool for creating email templates using a simple WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor. You can also schedule when emails are sent and have an analytics dashboard that shows how many emails have been sent, opened or clicked.

#### SET (Social Engineering Tookit)

The [Social Engineering Toolkit](https://www.trustedsec.com/tools/the-social-engineer-toolkit-set/) contains a multitude of tools, but some of the important ones for phishing are the ability to create spear-phishing attacks and deploy fake versions of common websites to trick victims into entering their credentials.

## Using GoPhish

## Droppers

Droppers are software that phishing victims tend to be tricked into downloading and running on their system. The dropper may advertise itself as something useful or legitimate such as a codec to view a certain video or software to open a specific file.

The droppers are not usually malicious themselves, so they tend to pass antivirus checks. Once installed, the intended malware is either unpacked or downloaded from a server and installed onto the victim's computer. The malicious software usually connects back to the attacker's infrastructure. The attacker can take control of the victim's computer, which can further explore and exploit the local network.
