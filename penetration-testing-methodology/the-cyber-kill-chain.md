# The Cyber Kill Chain

## 7 Stages

1. Reconnaissance
2. Weaponization
3. Delivery
4. Exploitation
5. Installation
6. Command and control
7. Actions

### Reconnaissance

* Cyber equivalent of "casing the joint"

* Port scan of active hosts
* Identify vectors for attack
* Checking software versions
* Automated scanning to scale the attack -- botnets

### Delivery

* Email attachment
* Compromised website
* Log into the target
  * Default credentials
  * Stolen credentials
* Internet-exposed vulnerability
* Flash drive

### Exploitation

* Exploit a vulnerability
* Unauthorized use of credentials
* Unaware execution of malware

### Installation

* Install payload into memory or disk
* Execute payload after system restart
* Provides ongoing access

### Command and Control

* Connect to the command and control server
* Receive commands
  * List subdirectories and files
  * Extract a named file
  * Modify or replace software
* Determine the command and control server address

### Actions
