# NoSQL Injection

## Example

> Example using a login form for Admin Access with username and password

* Intercept the login request with a basic username and password.
* If the Content-Type and data are not in JSON form it will have to be converted:
  * Manually, changing Content-Type to `application/json`
  * Burp Extension 'Content Type Converter'
    * Then right click in the request, select Content Type Converter, and select JSON
* May still need to modify the data to use JSON format, ex:
  * Before: `username=admin@admin.com&password=password&redirectPage=`
  * After: `{"username": "admin@admin.com", "password": "password"}`
* Send the request to get some response
* Example payloads below:

```bash
# Grab user where username is admin@admin.com and the password that is not equal to blank
{"username": "admin@admin.com", "password": {"$ne":""}}
# and the password that has a value greater than an empty string
{"username": "admin@admin.com", "password": {"$gt":""}}
```
