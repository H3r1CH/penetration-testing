## Cross-site Scripting

[https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet)

### What is cross-site scripting (XSS)?

Cross-site scripting (also known as XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application. It allows an attacker to circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to segregate different websites from each other. Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user's data. If the victim user has privileged access within the application, then the attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data.

### How does XSS work?

Cross-site scripting works by manipulating a vulnerable web site so that it returns malicious JavaScript to users. When the malicious code executes inside a victim's browser, the attacker can fully compromise their interaction with the application.

### What are the types of XSS attacks?

There are three main types of XSS attacks. These are:

* [Reflected XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting#reflected-cross-site-scripting), where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.
* [Stored XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting#stored-cross-site-scripting), where the malicious script comes from the website's database.
* [DOM-based XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting#dom-based-cross-site-scripting), where the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code.

### What can XSS be used for?

An attacker who exploits a cross-site scripting vulnerability is typically able to:

* Impersonate or masquerade as the victim user.
* Carry out any action that the user is able to perform.
* Read any data that the user is able to access.
* Capture the user's login credentials.
* Perform virtual defacement of the web site.
* Inject trojan functionality into the web site.

### Impact of XSS vulnerabilities

The actual impact of an XSS attack generally depends on the nature of the application, its functionality and data, and the status of the compromised user. For example:

* In a brochureware application, where all users are anonymous and all information is public, the impact will often be minimal.
* In an application holding sensitive data, such as banking transactions, emails, or healthcare records, the impact will usually be serious.
* If the compromised user has elevated privileges within the application, then the impact will generally be critical, allowing the attacker to take full control of the vulnerable application and compromise all users and their data.

### How to find and test for XSS vulnerabilities

The vast majority of XSS vulnerabilities can be found quickly and reliably using Burp Suite's [web vulnerability scanner](https://portswigger.net/burp/vulnerability-scanner).

Manually testing for reflected and stored XSS normally involves submitting some simple unique input (such as a short alphanumeric string) into every entry point in the application, identifying every location where the submitted input is returned in HTTP responses, and testing each location individually to determine whether suitably crafted input can be used to execute arbitrary JavaScript. In this way, you can determine the [context](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts) in which the XSS occurs and select a suitable payload to exploit it.

Manually testing for DOM-based XSS arising from URL parameters involves a similar process: placing some simple unique input in the parameter, using the browser's developer tools to search the DOM for this input, and testing each location to determine whether it is exploitable. However, other types of DOM XSS are harder to detect. To find [DOM-based vulnerabilities](https://portswigger.net/web-security/dom-based) in non-URL-based input (such as `document.cookie`) or non-HTML-based sinks (like `setTimeout`), there is no substitute for reviewing JavaScript code, which can be extremely time-consuming. Burp Suite's web vulnerability scanner combines static and dynamic analysis of JavaScript to reliably automate the detection of DOM-based vulnerabilities.

### How to prevent XSS attacks

Preventing cross-site scripting is trivial in some cases but can be much harder depending on the complexity of the application and the ways it handles user-controllable data.

In general, effectively preventing XSS vulnerabilities is likely to involve a combination of the following measures:

* **Filter input on arrival.** At the point where user input is received, filter as strictly as possible based on what is expected or valid input.
* **Encode data on output.** At the point where user-controllable data is output in HTTP responses, encode the output to prevent it from being interpreted as active content. Depending on the output context, this might require applying combinations of HTML, URL, JavaScript, and CSS encoding.
* **Use appropriate response headers.** To prevent XSS in HTTP responses that aren't intended to contain any HTML or JavaScript, you can use the `Content-Type` and `X-Content-Type-Options` headers to ensure that browsers interpret the responses in the way you intend.
* **Content Security Policy.** As a last line of defense, you can use Content Security Policy (CSP) to reduce the severity of any XSS vulnerabilities that still occur.

## Reflected

### What is reflected cross-site scripting?

Reflected cross-site scripting (or XSS) arises when an application receives data in an HTTP request and includes that data within the immediate response in an unsafe way.

### Impact of reflected XSS attacks

If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user. Amongst other things, the attacker can:

Perform any action within the application that the user can perform. View any information that the user is able to view. Modify any information that the user is able to modify. Initiate interactions with other application users, including malicious attacks, that will appear to originate from the initial victim user. There are various means by which an attacker might induce a victim user to make a request that they control, to deliver a reflected XSS attack. These include placing links on a website controlled by the attacker, or on another website that allows content to be generated, or by sending a link in an email, tweet or other message. The attack could be targeted directly against a known user, or could an indiscriminate attack against any users of the application:

The need for an external delivery mechanism for the attack means that the impact of reflected XSS is generally less severe than stored XSS, where a self-contained attack can be delivered within the vulnerable application itself.

### How to find and test for reflected XSS vulnerabilities

The vast majority of reflected cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can be found quickly and reliably using Burp Suite's [web vulnerability scanner](https://portswigger.net/burp/vulnerability-scanner).

Testing for reflected XSS vulnerabilities manually involves the following steps:

* **Test every entry point.** Test separately every entry point for data within the application's HTTP requests. This includes parameters or other data within the URL query string and message body, and the URL file path. It also includes HTTP headers, although XSS-like behavior that can only be triggered via certain HTTP headers may not be exploitable in practice.
* **Submit random alphanumeric values.** For each entry point, submit a unique random value and determine whether the value is reflected in the response. The value should be designed to survive most input validation, so needs to be fairly short and contain only alphanumeric characters. But it needs to be long enough to make accidental matches within the response highly unlikely. A random alphanumeric value of around 8 characters is normally ideal. You can use Burp Intruder's number payloads \[https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/intruder/payloads/types#numbers] with randomly generated hex values to generate suitable random values. And you can use Burp Intruder's [grep payloads option](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/intruder/options#grep-payloads) to automatically flag responses that contain the submitted value.
* **Determine the reflection context.** For each location within the response where the random value is reflected, determine its context. This might be in text between HTML tags, within a tag attribute which might be quoted, within a JavaScript string, etc.
* **Test a candidate payload.** Based on the context of the reflection, test an initial candidate XSS payload that will trigger JavaScript execution if it is reflected unmodified within the response. The easiest way to test payloads is to send the request to [Burp Repeater](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/repeater), modify the request to insert the candidate payload, issue the request, and then review the response to see if the payload worked. An efficient way to work is to leave the original random value in the request and place the candidate XSS payload before or after it. Then set the random value as the search term in Burp Repeater's response view. Burp will highlight each location where the search term appears, letting you quickly locate the reflection.
* **Test alternative payloads.** If the candidate XSS payload was modified by the application, or blocked altogether, then you will need to test alternative payloads and techniques that might deliver a working XSS attack based on the context of the reflection and the type of input validation that is being performed. For more details, see [cross-site scripting contexts](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts)
* **Test the attack in a browser.** Finally, if you succeed in finding a payload that appears to work within Burp Repeater, transfer the attack to a real browser (by pasting the URL into the address bar, or by modifying the request in [Burp Proxy's intercept view](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/proxy/intercept), and see if the injected JavaScript is indeed executed. Often, it is best to execute some simple JavaScript like `alert(document.domain)` which will trigger a visible popup within the browser if the attack succeeds.
